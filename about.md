Otherwise Productions is a boutique research, advocacy, design, and production unit - centralized primarily in the collaborations of anthropologist Chlo√© Frommer and designer Benjamin Kinzer and their associates.

Productions and deliverables are gained in association with unusual subjects (not the usual suspects) and by reading lack, otherwise. That is, wherever dark matters are deemed nothing but vaccuum or void, we use ethnography and design to recover meaning, substance, inspiration and agency.

Otherwise Productions endorses bioregional social and ecological movements, healing artists, and advocacy for indigenous peoples.

We have worked with Zimbabwean rainmakers to bring attention to the need for precautionary principles in contemporary weather modification.

We have worked with a local climate justice organization to show scientists, residents and indigenous people anticipating and framing climate adaptation locally.

We have worked to gain protection and representation for practictioners of indigenous healing traditions - vulnerable to excessive regulation and piracy.

We have worked with a high desert literary journal to highlight the arts and perspectives of the unique ecozone.

We have worked with breweries to call out how water quality effects beer styles.

We currently work to complete a 400-year-old historical canvas that calls out the liberal contingencies of justice that began with the Plymouth landing of the Mayflower in the land of the Wampanoag nation on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
