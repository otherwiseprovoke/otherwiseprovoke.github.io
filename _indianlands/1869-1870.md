- Cyrus Canon 1877 Allotment Survey review by Elizabeth Stops

In an effort to entice entrepreneurialism, the Dawes-General Allotment Act of 1870 (which followed
the Mashpee Allotments) privatized Indian land held between families and as a nation. Individuals proving
Indian descent were given simple title to Indian Lands that was alienable (although Indian Land - was
previously defined as inalienable). In the survey attached, Mashpee Wampanoag tribal member Elizabeth
Stops' great grandmother Rhoda Attaquin-Sturgis is one Wampanoag titled with allotment land in
Mashpee. Thus, Indian Land became Indian Lands - discrete parcels no longer protected.

- Based on 1834 District of Mashpee - Common lands distributed
- Massachusets General Court Decision: Mashpee Incorporated as a Town
- 1834 Vote to become a town/district: Solomon Attaquin (Father of Rhoda Attaquin-Sturgis)

Some Wampanoags supported the pressure to be liberal, and entrepreneurial. In fact they were in
support of a push to not only have Mashpee made a district, but to see its lands allotted so they could
sell it or make profitable businesses off of it. The day Mashpee became a town, however, lands held in
common, apart from Wampanoag's allotment lands, were deemed general use and were no longer
referencing the legal category of Indian Land - as was still very much being decided in Indian Country
west of the Mississsippi.
