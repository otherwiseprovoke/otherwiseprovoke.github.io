It is no small matter of irony, that the first real 'cut' into the definition of Indian Land happened
in Massachusetts during the Civil War. Because classic Liberal theory, supported civil rights and
equality upon the basis of individual land-holding, citizenship status it gave 'freed' African men
holding property as citizens the first rights to vote. Simultaneously, however,  Native American women who
held Indian Land as part of their natural rights were neither citizens or individuals deserving
civil rights under this conception. Further, because no European women held property at the time in
New England, Massachusetts did not consider them worthy of citizenship or the right to vote. It took another
60 years (until 1920) before women could gain citizenship and right to vote in New England. Because of this, an indigenous
custom of inheriting land through the matriline (shared by Wampanoag, Iroquois and many Eastern Woodland
tribes) was effaced as a matter of New England states desiring to "look good" as Union States supporting
foremostly, the rights of freed, African men. Native women who formerly had positions (as sachems), as councillors,
or the right to elect others in their place - were stripped of these rights as classic Liberal theory replaced
native sociopolitical and jural regimes.
