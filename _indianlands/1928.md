From once a sovereign nation with international relations with the British, to being called a mere Indian "tribe"
and then later "bands", the Wampanoags were greatly demoted since the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies participated in the formation of a new country (with the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution).
Although size-wise, Wampanoag numbers had shrank as had their homelands over the two centuries since contact with the Pilgrims, an early twentieth century scheme proposed by Evolutionist anthropologists suggested that the Wampanoags' social, cultural and political diminishment was a "natural" process (evolution or worse, devolution). A tribe in particular is viewed as less
complex, coherent, and stable than states or nations (see writings by anthropologist Elman Service). Due in part to the cultural and demographic (not political or legal) diminishment of indigenous Americans in the US, also in the early 20th century, the federal government formed the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) by which anthropologists might conduct "salvage ethnography".

One such anthropologist, Frank Speck, conducted ethnographic fieldwork among the remaining Wampanoag (called Nauset then) on Cape Cod. But focused as he (and other anthropologists) were upon tribal bands and tribal families, family names, and their remaining tribal affiliations as evidence (or lack thereof) of cultural, political, social and legal continuity it was hardly clear to Speck or other anthropologists' that encroachment upon Wampanoags' sovereign political, civil and natural rights had led to the diminishment of their people and 'territories'. Indeed, the monograph he wrote on the Cape Cod Indians
is backed primarily by citations from Pilgrim sources like like William Bradford, Peter Winslow and
Wampanoag overseers like Peter Gookin. Not surprisingly, very little evidence of linguistic (Algonquin) or cultural resources (ethnohistory, oral traditions, place names) was "found" - thus leaving a representation of Wampanoag that played right along with the blood-quantum politics of the day: that Indians were only racially different, not culturally or politically different.
