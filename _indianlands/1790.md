- Federal Non-Intercourse Act
- BIA - Defintions of Indian Land

_Indian Land_ did not become a defined legal category until after the American
Revolution - when the colonists had to determine on their own what to do with the "Indian Problem".
Indian Land was established as that which could not be alienated without an Act of Congress. Prior
to that, the Wampanoag supreme sachem was treated as a sovereign and the people, sovereigns of their
own land. Eventually through encroachment, Wampanoags became subject to the English Crown and Law - traveling frequently to England to petition the King on behalf of his other subjects' the Colonists unfair,
greedy and behavior. Back then, diplomacy almost always required the King side on behalf of the original
inhabitants and hosts of the new colony - with, however, little enforcements given to that side. The
paternalism was not 'won' therefore so much as assumed and is why we see in Mashpee - the mainly
Indian plantation set up, but with a white, overseer.
